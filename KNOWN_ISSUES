- In error responses, official docs say "reason" is "text" but its actually an object.
- /deleteMonitor, editMonitor, resetMonitor: uses SingleMonitorResponse, but does not return MonitorState
- Using "oneOf" for responses means swagger editor cannot (at time of writing) generate the examples.

Suggestions:

- /getMonitors response, offset+limit+total are in a pagination object but for
  /getAlertContacts they are in the root level. Ideally only one convention should
  be used for consistency.
