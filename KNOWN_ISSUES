- In error responses, official docs say "reason" is "text" but its actually an object.
- /deleteMonitor, editMonitor, resetMonitor: uses SingleMonitorResponse, but returns Partial<SingleMonitorResponse>
- Using "oneOf" for responses means swagger editor cannot (at time of writing) generate the examples.
- /newAlertContact, editAlertContact response uses SingleAlertContactResponse but returns Partial<SingleAlertContactResponse>
- MWindow>user: unsure what this is
- MWindow>value: unsure how to use this
- PSP>hide_url_links: assumed [0,1] convention for boolean parameter

Suggestions:

- /getMonitors response, offset+limit+total are in a pagination object but for
  /getAlertContacts they are in the root level. Ideally only one convention should
  be used for consistency.
- inconsistent casing in responses eg. "alert_contacts" and "alertcontact".
- response objects should not be partial eg. /newAlertContact should return the AlertContact object
- avoid overloaded parameters eg. MWindow>start_time: "Unix time for type=1 and HH:mm for other types"
